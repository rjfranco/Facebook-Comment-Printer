# Facebook Comment Printer
## Simply Enter the URL who's comments you want, and then hit print.

This application is only intended to be used for printing comments to be read for your own use. It currently works, but needs severe refactoring. Right now there is a helper that generates markup in the view, the functionality from the helper needs to be moved to some kind of faux-model so that it can then be manipulated in a view just like a regular data model.

Besides that though, it all seems to be working as intended. I'm going to make a couple of style updates, but until I have a little more time to refactor, this will probably just work as it is.
